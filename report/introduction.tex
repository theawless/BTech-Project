Speech recognition, which is able to recognize human speech and convert it to text, has emerged as the new trending technology in IT industry. Mobile users desire devices that they can control without physical interaction.

Applications like Siri and Cortana are steadily gaining popularity with their hands free features like taking reminders and notes, opening other applications, and saying witty replies. With the advancement in network capabilities, these applications can send data over to the server where sophisticated algorithms provide exceptionally accurate recognition results. In countries like India where over 75 percent of the population has no internet, these applications fail. Moreover, privacy is a big issue as these systems share the voice data with third party servers.

In this work, we aim to implement a light-weight embedded speech recognition system for mobile devices. In chapter \ref{ch:survey}, we discuss few related works and technologies of the proposed system. Chapter \ref{ch:proposal} presents the design and implementation of the proposed speech recognition system. Finally, we draw out conclusions and discuss the future work in chapter \ref{ch:conclusion}.
