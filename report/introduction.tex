Mobile users desire devices that they can control without much physical interaction. Applications like Siri are steadily gaining popularity with their hands free features. They can send data over to servers where sophisticated algorithms provide exceptionally accurate recognition results.
However in countries like India, where over 75 percent of the population has no internet, these applications are not suitable. Privacy is also a concern as these systems can share voice data with third parties. While open-source embedded systems like PocketSphinx are present, they require large amounts of training data which is usually not available for unpopular languages and is hard to collect and annotate.

In this work, we aim to implement a portable word based embedded speech recognition system for mobile phones, along with a graphics user interface for training on desktop, and a demonstrative voice controlled assistant for android. In chapter \ref{ch:survey}, we discuss a few related works and technologies of the proposed system. In chapter \ref{ch:proposal} we present the design and implementation of the proposed systems. In chapter \ref{ch:experiment} we discuss the expermients performed and their observations. Finally, we draw out conclusions and discuss the future work in chapter \ref{ch:conclusion}. In the appendix, we provide details of the assumed knowledge.
