\chapter*{\centering Abstract}

\textit{\quad Voice centric interfaces have become widely available with the evolution of mobile phones. Progress in speech recognition algorithms, increased network capabilities and computational powers have promoted this growth. Applications of speech recognition include, but are not limited to chat-bots, dialing, web search, and dictation of text messages. In this work, we implement a portable word based embedded speech recognition library, a graphical user interface for training, and a demonstrative android application.}
