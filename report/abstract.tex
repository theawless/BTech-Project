\chapter*{\centering Abstract}

\textit{\quad Automatic speech recognition systems are an integral part of every voice-based assistant. Voice centric interfaces have become widely available with the evolution of mobile phones. Advancements in speech recognition algorithms, increased computational power and networking capacities have enabled this growth. Its applications include but are not limited to dialing, web search, and dictation of text messages. In this work, we implement a light-weight embedded speech recognition system using phoneme segmentation, linear predictive coding and template matching. We have taken a dataset of digits spoken in moderately quiet environment. The results indicate that the proposed system is able to identify the spoken digits with over 75\% accuracy.}
