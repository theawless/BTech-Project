\chapter{Experiment and Observation} \label{ch:experiment}

We obtained two datasets for the purpose of experimentation - digits dataset of 15 utterances per digit, and commands (for the android project) dataset with 25 utterances per word. The recordings were done in moderately quiet environments using a general-purpose microphone.

For the obtained datasets, the trimming algorithm presented very accurate results. The results were close to 88\% for the error of speech signal's endpoints missing by 100ms.

It was observed that for the two datasets, different configurations were necessary. The accuracy of digits dataset decreased if delta or delta delta features were added; on the contrary, it increased for commands dataset. The optimal codebook size and the number of HMM states were higher for commands dataset compared to digits dataset. Moreover, bakis model with more jumps improved the performance for commands dataset.

For profiling the library on a desktop, Visual Studio Profiler was used and a Intel Corei7 3.0GHz + 8GB RAM laptop was selected. During training, the maximum CPU usage increased up to 80\% while the maximum RAM usage was below 20MB for our datasets.

For profiling the android application, Android Studio Profiler was used and an octa-core 1.7GHz + 2GB RAM mobile phone was selected. During testing, the maximum CPU usage increased up to 50\% while the RAM stayed constant at 12MB. The average recognition time for input utterances was 15ms.
