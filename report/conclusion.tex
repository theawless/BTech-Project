It was noticed that the autocorrelation based phoneme segmentation is a slow algorithm for a real-time speech recognition system. We would like to improve phoneme segmentation by looking at other techniques. Our system did not use any sophisticated algorithms for template matching. We noticed that the system performed unsatisfactorily for changes in accents and environments. The main cause of this is the direct use of the cepstral coefficients; we would like to improve on that by using aligning techniques such as Dynamic Time Warping.
Another improvement we can make in the system is by profiling the mobile user. It is generally seen that a there is a one to one correspondence between users and mobiles. Hence, we can save user's old recordings and improve our system continuously.
